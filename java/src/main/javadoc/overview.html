        <h1>Overview of the Cedarling Java Wrapper</h1>

        <p>
            The Cedarling Java Wrapper provides a Java interface to interact with the 
            <a href="https://docs.jans.io/stable/cedarling">Cedarling</a> library, which 
            is written in Rust. This library enables Java developers, to leverage Cedarling's 
            functionality for policy evaluation and authorization in a seamless and idiomatic 
            Java manner.
        </p>

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The wrapper consists of two primary components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>The Rust JNI Interface library</b>: A translation layer that bridges the Rust-based 
                Cedarling library and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) using Java Native Interface (JNI).
                This layer handles the low-level communication and data marshalling between Java and Rust.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The Java Library</b>: A high-level Java API that provides a convenient and type-safe interface
                 for interacting with Cedarling via the Rust JNI Interface above. This library exposes the core
                 functionality of Cedarling through the {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling Cedarling} class, which
                 serves as the primary entry point for policy evaluation and authorization tasks.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Usage of Builders</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure some underlying rust objects used for cedarling are valid, use of a builder pattern for both the Java
            configuration and authentication objects is encouraged , although not enforced. These builders can help catch invalid 
            object states, albeit ultimately the rust cedarling engine will do the required validation. The builders just make sure
            they objects passed are "rust-compliant". An example would be that rust doesn't have a {@code null} concept, which makes 
            it imperative null values aren't passed to cedarling.  As the library evolves, a decision will be made to make the use of 
            builders mandatory. It will simplify the code in the Rust JNI Interface library. 
        </p>

        <h2>Core Concept</h2>
        <p>
            The central component of this library is the {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling Cedarling} class, which encapsulates
            the interaction with the underlying Rust-based cedarling library. An instance of this class maps directly to a Rust instance 
            of the Cedarling engine, and it's methods marshall data to-from Cedarling internally. As the object holds native Rust resources,
            it implements {@link java.lang.AutoCloseable AutoCloseable} to ensure proper resource cleanup. 
        </p>

        <h2>Usage Example</h2>
        <p>
            Please check the examples directory within the same project for usage samples. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Resource Management Warning</h2>
        <div>
            <b>Important</b>: The {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling Cedarling} class holds native Rust resources through the JNI interface.
            To prevent resource leaks, it is critical to either:
            <ul>
                <li>Use the {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling Cedarling} object within a try-with-resources block, which automatically calls
                     {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling#close()} when the block is exited, or 
                </li>
                <li>Explicitly call {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling#close()} when the object is no longer needed</li>
            </ul>
            Failure to properly close the {@link io.jans.cedarling.bridge.Cedarling} object may result in memory leaks or other resource-related 
            issues in the underlying Rust layer.
        </div>
